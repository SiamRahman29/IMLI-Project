## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### New Function: `analyze_trending_content_and_store()`
```python
def analyze_trending_content_and_store(db: Session, analyzer: 'TrendingBengaliAnalyzer', 
                                     content: List[Dict], source: str, target_date: date):
    """

    """
```

**Key Features:**
- Tracks unique newspaper sources
- Counts newspapers per phrase

final_score = tfidf_score * source_weight * recency_weight + newspaper_boost
```

### Output Format (As Requested):
```
1. ইরানের                    : 0.214 : from 2 newspapers
