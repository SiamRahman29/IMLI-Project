      "content": "Something happened yesterday night that‚Äôs been weighing heavily on me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were out together. I stepped away briefly to grab some tea from a nearby tong, while she waited on the sidewalk. When I came back, I found her visibly agitated and upset. She told me that while I was gone, a group of three older men (probably in their 50s or so) were staring at her, checking her out, and making vulgar comments.\n\nHearing this, I walked over to them to confront the situation, to ask what was was going on. But before I could even get a word in, my girlfriend, clearly fired up and emotional, started reacting loudly to them. It escalated quickly, so I pulled her away from there to calm her down and avoid things getting worse.\n\nLater, she broke down crying and asked me why I didn‚Äôt confront them more directly or do more to defend her in the moment. I honestly didn‚Äôt know what to say ‚Äî I felt completely helpless. I couldn‚Äôt even begin to imagine how vulnerable she must‚Äôve felt in that moment. All I wanted was to keep her safe and get her away from the situation, but now I‚Äôm left feeling like I failed in my basic duty to protect the person I care most about.I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night, replaying everything in my head.\n\nI just wanted to get that off my chest and ask you all for suggestions on what could I have done differently, and how should I handle this situation in future?",

It was her natural response to feeling unsafe and vulnerable, and honestly, people who harass women on the street deserve to be called out. Later she reacted strongly only because she knew you had her back, which you surely did. You calmed the situation down and got her away from a dangerous situation, given how quickly mob drama can ignite when a woman is involved. \n\nShe might‚Äôve said you didn‚Äôt do enough because she was hurt and overwhelmed at thar moment, buut i can assure you that once she cools off, she‚Äôll see you were doing your best to protect her.

I just had a thought while watching the news, couldn't they just modify some things with the new curriculum? Like, I remember how the the ICT book was really good there. Now, the the book seems to me  that it's 10 to 12 years behind. So, couldn't we do something like where, ever subject has some class work and, everything you do in class is counted on your marks? If we did something like that, because, then people would have pressure to study all year. Plus you have examination life half monthly and finals. So, people would study. And learn all the time. With books that are updated every 3 years or so. And, even if the gov doesn't do something like this, they should do it not within two years. I think, they should give them selves minimum of 5 years. Us class 10 and 9 are doomed. We wasted our grade 7,8,9s. Now, most of us are really under prepared for the ssc examinations. \n\nI was just wondering things like this while watching the news. And I wanted your guy's thoughts on this. And, what do you think would be a good sort of implementation?

        "My advice would be first know how much your family can spend on your education then select countries and universities based on that. Scholarship for masters in Canada is rare. Europe is a valid option still you will need around 20lakh for masters. Maybe less in some parts of Europe.\n\nYou can't cover your tuition fees by doing odd jobs in any country. So forget about that. Overall scholarship opportunities in Europe are much lower for masters as most European countries don't offer TAship or RAship to masters students. Try for Erasmus scholarship. It's competitive but will cover full cost. You can also look into S. Korea for cheaper tuition fees and they offer around 50% scholarship if your cgpa is high.",

      "content": "\nIspita was a bright, brave, and hardworking student of Zoology, 3rd year, at Bhola Govt. College. A girl full of hope, once believing in change. She tried politics, only to walk away after seeing how dirty and cruel it truly is. She was also the daughter of an auto driver. A father who now stands shattered, crying out the most heartbreaking question:\n\n> \"Ami auto driver, amar meyer bichar ki pabo?\"\n(\"I am an auto driver, will I ever get justice for my daughter?\")\n\n\n\nShe was gang raped on the Karnaphuli-4 launch. On that night, maybe she jumped into the river to escape. Maybe they threw her in after they were done. Either way, she died. Her body was found days later and buried as beyowarish, like she was no one. No name. No dignity. No justice.\n\nNow her classmates are saying what we all fear. This might not have been random. Maybe it was a planned attack. Maybe someone wanted to silence her. Someone who couldn‚Äôt accept her voice, her spirit, her courage.\n\nAnd here we are. Scrolling. Posting. Feeling angry for a few hours or a couple of days. Then forgetting. Like we always do.\n\nWhy do we let this happen every time?\nWhy do we treat rage like a trend instead of a responsibility?\nWhy do we only act when tragedy knocks on our own door?\n\nWhat‚Äôs even worse is what comes next. Tomorrow, people will say she was characterless. They will ask what she was wearing. They will blame her instead of the monsters who did this. That is how it always goes. That is why this continues.\n\nThis incident is not isolated. It is a result of what we allowed. Just recently, a man beat up two women in public on a launch, and nothing happened to him. No arrest. No punishment. That silence gave courage to the next group of predators.\n\nSo again, I ask:\n\nWhy do we stay quiet?\nWhy do we only react for a moment and then go back to normal life?\nWhy do we let our sisters die like this and then move on?\n\nWe failed Ispita.\nWe failed her father.\nAnd unless we act, we will keep failing others too.\n\nThis country owes them justice.

Justice depends on your title, your tie, or maybe even your *terrifying silence*.\n\nIspita may have been bold, brilliant, and perhaps dangerous not because she had a weapon, but because she had a spine unlike many people I know. She dared to think change was possible, that maybe the dirt of politics could be scrubbed off with courage and clarity. *Guess what?* The system doesn‚Äôt like clean hands. So it swallowed her whole, then spat her into a river. Left her to rot like *trash*. Like her name, her soul, and her scream didn‚Äôt matter.\n\nAnd what are *we* doing?\n\nScrolling. Double-tapping. Writing a sad little caption with a black background and a broken heart emoji, and calling it activism.   \n  \nAlso I disagree about cowardice.  \n  \nWe‚Äôre not *afraid* to speak up, *we‚Äôre too damn busy*. With our own crumbling lives, our rents, our GPAs, our mental breakdowns dressed as productivity. And the bastards who run this mess? They *count on that distraction*.

        " \n\nscore is highly subjective to how difficult the admission test is, and how your peer group is performing on the admission test.\n\nMajor  choice should be dependent on your own personal interest and career  goal. Applied physics of DU and EEE in BUET both have similar syllabus,  but EEE BUET currently has highest number of PhDs from North America. So  if you are interested in research or academia, EEE BUET is your safest  bet. There are some faculty members who work on Robotics as well in EEE.  If you are more interested in Programming and math problem, BUET CSE  would work best for you.  They are exceptionally strong in Algorithm  research.\n\nFor Nuclear Engineering, unfortunately, DU does not have sufficient number of faculty members having PhD ([https://www.du.ac.bd/academic/department\\_item\\_details/faculty/NED](https://www.du.ac.bd/academic/department_item_details/faculty/NED)). Consider an Undergrad in mechanical engineering or electrical engineering, and then get a Master's from abroad.",
