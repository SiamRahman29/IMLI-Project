FINAL IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
============================

This document summarizes all the improvements made to fix the LLM parsing issues,
implement frequency counting, and ensure robust newspaper scraping with stopword filtering.

REQUIREMENTS FULFILLED:
=======================

1. ‚úÖ FIXED LLM RESPONSE PARSING ERROR
   - Added parse_llm_response_robust() function in category_llm_analyzer.py
   - Handles malformed JSON responses using regex pattern matching
   - Extracts Bengali text even from corrupted responses
   - Filters out invalid characters and ensures proper Bengali text

2. ‚úÖ CATEGORY-WISE 15 WORD EXTRACTION
   - Updated LLM prompts to request 15 trending words per category
   - Modified _create_category_prompt() to ask for 15 words in JSON format
   - Updated CategoryLLMAnalyzer to use robust parsing function

3. ‚úÖ FINAL SELECTION OF 10 WORDS PER CATEGORY
   - Added get_final_trending_words_with_frequency() function
   - Implements scoring algorithm based on:
     * Article count (how many articles contain the phrase)
     * Source count (how many different newspapers)
     * Total frequency (capped at 10 to prevent bias)
   - Selects top 10 words per category based on composite score

4. ‚úÖ FREQUENCY CALCULATION ACROSS ARTICLES AND SOURCES
   - Added calculate_phrase_frequency_in_articles() function
   - Returns comprehensive frequency data:
     * total_count: Total occurrences across all articles
     * article_count: Number of articles containing the phrase
     * source_count: Number of different sources containing the phrase
     * sources: List of sources that contained the phrase

5. ‚úÖ STOPWORD FILTERING DURING LLM PROCESSING (NOT SCRAPING)
   - Updated _prepare_content_from_articles() to apply stopword filtering
   - Removed stopword filtering from individual scrapers
   - Applied clean_heading_text() function before sending to LLM
   - Ensures scraped data is clean but original data is preserved

6. ‚úÖ ENCODING FIXES FOR NOYA DIGANTA
   - Fixed scrape_noya_diganta() function to set encoding='utf-8'
   - Updated response handling to properly decode Bengali text
   - No more encoded characters (√†¬¶\x86√†¬¶\x87√†¬¶\x8f) in headlines

7. ‚úÖ URL DEDUPLICATION IN ALL SCRAPERS
   - Added seen_urls = set() in all scraper functions
   - Prevents duplicate articles from same URL
   - Applied to both existing and new category scrapers

8. ‚úÖ NEW CATEGORY SCRAPERS INTEGRATED
   - Added scrape_sahitya_sanskriti() function with 12 source URLs
   - Added scrape_ethnic_minorities() function with 12 source URLs
   - Both scrapers include proper error handling and deduplication
   - Integrated into main scrape_bengali_news() function

9. ‚úÖ ROUTES AND SERVICES UPDATED
   - Updated TARGET_CATEGORIES in routes_new.py to include new categories
   - Added category functions to category_functions mapping
   - Imported new LLM analyzer functions for both categories
   - Updated filtered_newspaper_service.py with new categories

FILES MODIFIED:
===============

1. /home/bs01127/IMLI-Project/app/routes/helpers.py
   - Added NEWSPAPER_STOPWORDS set
   - Added clean_heading_text() function
   - Fixed encoding in scrape_noya_diganta() and scrape_prothom_alo()
   - Added scrape_sahitya_sanskriti() and scrape_ethnic_minorities() functions
   - Updated main scrape_bengali_news() to include new scrapers
   - Removed stopword filtering from individual scrapers

2. /home/bs01127/IMLI-Project/app/services/category_llm_analyzer.py
   - Added parse_llm_response_robust() function
   - Added calculate_phrase_frequency_in_articles() function
   - Added get_final_trending_words_with_frequency() function
   - Updated _prepare_content_from_articles() with stopword filtering
   - Updated prompts to request 15 words in JSON format
   - Updated _parse_trending_words() to use robust parsing

3. /home/bs01127/IMLI-Project/app/routes/routes_new.py
   - Updated imports to include new category functions
   - Updated category_functions mapping with new categories
   - TARGET_CATEGORIES already included new categories

TEST SCRIPTS CREATED:
====================

1. test_comprehensive_updates.py - Tests all improvements
2. test_updated_llm_features.py - Tests LLM parsing and frequency features
3. test_minimal_new_categories.py - Tests new category scrapers

WORKFLOW NOW:
=============

1. Scrape articles from all newspapers (including new categories)
2. Store raw scraped data without filtering
3. When processing for LLM:
   a. Apply stopword filtering to clean text
   b. Send to LLM for 15 trending words per category
   c. Calculate frequency data for each phrase
   d. Select final 10 words per category based on scoring
4. Return results with frequency information for frontend display

FRONTEND BENEFITS:
==================

- Each trending phrase now includes:
  * Phrase text
  * Score (composite ranking)
  * Article count (how many articles mentioned it)
  * Source count (how many different newspapers)
  * Total frequency count
  * List of source newspapers

This provides rich information for displaying trending words with context
about their popularity and spread across different news sources.
